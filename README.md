<h1>üê∫ Hi, my name is Jimmy. üñ•Ô∏è</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Jimmy. 
I started programming when I was in my high school during my junior year and my first programming language I learned was Java. I did programming some projects during my time at college.
I still have two old MTA certificates at JATC in West Jordan, Utah. I did went to college called University of Utah for two years pursuing Computer Science.
When the Covid hit, I changed my major to IT and graduated with an associate degree in Information Systems and Technology. Last year, I went back college and I'm emrolling at Western Governor University to finish my Bachelor's degree in IT. I will be graduate before at the end of 2025.
